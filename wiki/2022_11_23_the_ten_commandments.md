## The Number of Commandments

In the instances where the commandments have been enumerated in the new testament, they have either been the summary having the two commandments or the a short list of only 5, with the exception of Mark 10 where Christ also add another commandment, "Defraud not". But we can be sure that God gave to Moses two tablets of stone having ten commandments. For the record says, "And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, *the ten commandments.*" *Exodus 34:28*. "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, [even] *ten commandments*; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone." *Deuteronomy 4:13* "And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, *the ten commandments,* which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me" *Deuteronomy 10:4*
